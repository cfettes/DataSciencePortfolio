a.	Banknotes Authentication: the banknote authentication dataset is about distinguishing genuine and forged banknotes. To produce this dataset, images were taken from both genuine and forged banknotes. Then a special tool, Wavelet Transform, was used to extract features from these images. These features are: variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy of the images. These features capture the necessary information about the images. K-Means clustering was used to cluster the dataset into 2 clusters based on banknote features     

b.	E-Commerce Customer Segmentation: firstly, NLP techniques were used to create product categories from product descriptions, customer purchases were aggregated to create a single entry per customer, and this information was used to create customer clusters. These clusters were then used as labels on which to build a classifier to predict which cluster a customer belongs to. By converting an unsupervised task into a supervised task, performance can be evaluated and with generation of further data, feed back into the model can improve the performance of the model
