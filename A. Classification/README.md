a.	Bank Marketing Analysis: using a dataset collected from a direct marketing campaign of a bank institution from Portugal, the purpose of this project is to predict if a call to a client would be successful or not based on client details, and ascertain feature importance as described by the model with the best performance in order to understand what client attributes are most important in determining success rate of bank telemarketing.    

b.	Basetrack Source Discrimination: the goal here is to develop a prediction model to discriminate between electromagnetic shower-generated basetracks and background basetracks.     

c.	Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction: utilising the UCI Machine Learning repository breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, the goal is to predict diagnosis (malignant or benign). A number of classifiers are trialed on the dataset, with K-fold cross validation used and performance of the classifier evaluated. Once individual models have been used, classifiers are stacked to see if this improves performance over individual models. The best performed is then trained and tested on the unseen test data. XGBClassifier was found to perform the best, achieving an accuracy of 96.49% and recall of 93.02%, with 3 false negatives out of 43 ‘Malignant’ diagnoses    

d.	Classification MNIST: this developed, implemented and tested four algorithms written from scratch in Python (no libraries were used) for classifying the MNIST dataset – generative mode, nearest neighbour, One vs All Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks    

e.	Gaussian Generative Wine Classification: this experiments with the Gaussian classification of winery data, writing the code from scratch. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate Gaussian were used.   

f.	Logistic Regression from Scratch to Predict Cervical Cancer   

g.	Particle Identification: this uses particle responses to detector or subdetector systems to predict particle type out of 6 possibilities. Gradient Boosting Classifier and Keras NN were used, with the NN performing the best, with a log loss of 0.56 (compared to 0.67 of GB)    

h.	Predict Signal Events: the goal was to build a classifier to predict simulated signal events out of real data observing collisions of accelerated particles
